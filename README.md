# base144515 - An enormous number base
This is a Python 3 program that defines and allows you to convert between regular base 10 and a new number base, base144515. This base contains every publicly usable non-whitespace non-zero-width printable character in Unicode(apart from the default “ “ Latin alphabet space) and gives it a value, allowing users to represent extremely large numbers in extremely few characters. It also allows users to query Unicode and see which characters have what value within the base system. 

You can run the program in the command line by specifying which conversion the user wants to do (1 being converting to base144515, 2 being converting to base10, 3 being to query values in a given string)

To be honest I should have just made all of this a class but I doubt anyone wants to use this anyway

#### Examples
The number 111111111111 in base10 is represented as 5먿糵 in base 144515 <br/>
The number 499187406822517 in base10 is represented as 我爱你 in base 144515 <br/>
The number 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 in base10 is represented as 鋈ﴢ𖮀𰀽撾敜𥟀𡵭𣭲𬓝 in base144515 <br/>

Note: while many of these characters may appear as black boxes (due to them not being supported by the fonts on whichever device this is being viewed on), they are all official Unicode characters and can be uniquely identified if copied and pasted back into the program.
